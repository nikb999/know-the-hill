Explore the links between the Federal Agencies and your congressional representative.

This project looks at the congressional committies that have oversight over the different
branches of Federal government.

A key challenge facing Government Relations (GR) professionals is to determine who in 
Congress is the right person to talk to regarding issues that are important to the GR person.  
These could be related to the particular US
Government agency that the GR person's firm does business with and/or specific
legislation consideration that can affect the GR person's firm/interests.

This task of identifying the right audience has typically been the purview of
lobbyists and other professional organizations. A GR professional working for a private 
business often relies on such lobbying
assistance and pay a substantial sum in fees and retainers to engage the
lobbyists.

This site is intended to assist the GR Professional to start identifying the
key Senators and Representatives who have a disproportional influence on the
business interests that the GR professional is supporting.   The Senators and 
Representatives have this influence via their membership to the Congressional 
Committees that provide oversight to the Federal Agencies.

The site does not replace the important role that professional lobbyists
play.  The site seeks to provide an
alternative mechanism and tools to the GR Professional to better educate
themselves on the inter-relationships between the Legislative Branch and the
Executive Branch of the US Government.

A Note on Methodology

The system of oversight of US Federal Agencies by Congressional Committees is not straightforward.  
There are committees that have very specific
listing of agencies that they have jurisdiction over; while there are other
committees that state their jurisdiction over specific functions or activities
(rather than specific agencies) that may be performed by multiple agencies,
leaving the analyst to wonder if the committee has jurisdiction over every
agency that may perform any part of the stated function/activity (however
small).

The data for linking the federal agency to the congressional committee was
collected from several sources. The primary data source was FDsys databases
that provide records of the congressional hearings.  From this information, we culled out the
names of the federal agencies whose officials provided testimony to the
committee hearings.  An important assumption was made: if the agency official testified at a hearing of a
specific committee then the committee had jurisdiction over the agency.  It is important to note that not all
committees have the same level of influence on the federal agencies.  Some committees such as Appropriations have a
much greater level of influence than other committees. 

The data collected from the committee hearings was complemented with
information from the jurisdiction sections of the websites of the
committees.  Some level of judgment was involved here to link the committee to 
an agency based on the description on the committee website.
